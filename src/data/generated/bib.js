        "abstract": "\"The emerging infrastructure of cyber-physical systems consisting of everyday items, as product's packaging, and advanced digital communication devices opens a new digital dimension for interaction and user experience. Consequently, the concept of human-packaging interaction goes beyond the pragmatic aspects of physical packaging attributes, and, in turn, embraces the potentials of ICT systems. Due to the new forms of human-packaging interactive systems, designers have to address the relevancy of the interaction design and the complexity in the relationship between consumer behavior and interactive system design, i.e. digitally-enhanced packaging. Therefore this research aims to describe the digitally-enhanced packaging as a digital interactive system in regards to the theories of human-computer interaction, interaction design, and user-centered design. In this paper, the critical elements of the interactive packaging design are described. This study concludes that for the interactive systems to be effective and used, designers have to build not only a reward-based, intuitive and simple interaction design that would persuade users to take actions, but also they have to think of other mediate interactions, internal and external resources that are significant to reach the final aim.\",",

        "abstract": "This exploratory research aims to track the recent trends in food packaging design, through multiple case studies, to examine the core concepts of creative packaging and the implementation of the recent technology in the packaging industry. The research focuses on technology and its impact on design, functionality, and user experience, to highlight recommendations that could help designers and marketers to determine the essential information and elements in packaging. Also, to consider the possibility of using these new trends to stimulate, attract, and convince customers, and motivate their buying behavior and decision-making. The study also emphasizes the vast role of the smart and intelligent package to increase the interaction with consumers and help them to ensure the quality of the product and interact with them technologically through sensors of the active packaging. The researchers suggest that companies and designers should design packages in line with the consumers' experience process and invest in the smart packages to increase interaction in three main stages, sensation, Attraction, and Functionality; to raise consumers satisfaction, especially through smart technology. Moreover, to reduce the amount of food waste and support recycling, by connecting them through their smartphone to review the detailed information in that context.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, consumers have paid more and more attention to the source and safety of commodities and food, and the traceability of the supply chain has become very important. Most of the current supply chain adopts centralized management. If multiple parties are involved (production, processing, transportation, etc.), the existing centralized management method requires a lot of manpower costs to help achieve the supply due to the isolation of data and lack of trust. In recent years, blockchain technology has been widely used due to its inherent characteristics, such as distributed ledger and cryptography, to overcome the trust problem among entities which means that entities do not rely on the central organization (e.g., central authority) or a third-party intermediary unit (e.g., intermediary). Thus, the blockchain technology is applied to many applications and industries, especially the logistics industry. Currently, the logistics company needs to help buyers and sellers to advance and import goods by using the phone to negotiate for the money. This process is very inefficient. In this work, we propose a multi-party supply chain system with traceability based on the blockchain technologies.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain offers traceability and transparency to supply chain event data and hence can help overcome many challenges in supply chain management. However, data privacy concerns such as the protection of trade secrets have hindered adoption of blockchain technology. Although consortium blockchains only allow authorised supply chain entities to read/write to the ledger, privacy preservation of trade secrets cannot be ascertained. In this work, we propose a privacy-preservation framework, PrivChain, to protect sensitive data on blockchain using zero knowledge proofs. PrivChain provides provenance and traceability without revealing any sensitive information to end-consumers or supply chain entities. Its novelty stems from: a) its ability to allow data owners to protect trade related information and instead provide proofs on the data, and b) its integrated incentive mechanism for entities providing valid proofs using Zero Knowledge Range Proofs (ZKRPs) to provide origin information without disclosing the exact location of a supply chain product. Furthermore, the framework allows to compute proofs and commitments off-line, decoupling the computational overhead from blockchain. The proof verification process and incentive payment initiation are automated using blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and events. A proof of concept implementation on Hyperledger Fabric reveals a minimal overhead of using PrivChain for blockchain enabled supply chains.",

        "abstract": "Gas sensors present an alternative to traditional off-package food quality assessment, due to their high sensitivity and fast response without the need of sample pretreatment. The safe integration of gas sensors into packaging without compromising sensitivity, response rate, and stability, however, remains a challenge. Such packaging integration of spoilage sensors is crucial for preventing food waste and transitioning toward more sustainable supply chains. Here, we demonstrate a wide-ranging solution to enable the use of gas sensors for the continuous monitoring of food spoilage, building upon our previous work on paper-based electrical gas sensors (PEGS). By comparing various materials commonly used in the food industry, we analyze the optimal membrane to encapsulate PEGS for packaging integration. Focusing on spinach as a high-value crop, we assess the feasibility of PEGS to monitor the gases released during its spoilage at low and room temperatures. Finally, we integrated the sensors with wireless communication and batteryless electronics, creating a user-friendly system to evaluate the spoilage of spinach, operated by a smartphone via near-field communication (NFC). The work reported here provides an alternative approach that surpasses traditional on-site and in-line monitoring, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of food shelf life.",

        "abstract": "Counterfeiting of food and beverage products is rife and premium brands are often targeted by fraudsters. Such is the case with Scotch whisky, a global, reputable brand revered for its heritage and tradition. Using Scotch whisky as a case study, the aim of this paper is to review existing literature and industry information to determine the market and personal consequences of counterfeiting activities and consider the packaging related anti-counterfeiting measures that can be employed within a wider anti-counterfeiting strategy. A typology of counterfeiting activities is developed including: tear-down counterfeiting, product overruns, malicious activities and document counterfeiting. Anti-counterfeiting measures are used to deter, detect and control counterfeiting activities and different packaging related approaches include the use of smart covert and overt technology. Most smart packaging-related anti-counterfeit technologies are stand-alone systems and this presents a vulnerability. An integrated anti-counterfeiting measures strategy, employed by business, the supply chain and the government is required to reduce the risk of the sale of counterfeit food and beverage products.",

        "abstract": "<p>Smart packaging, an emerging technology in the food packaging industry incorporates both active and intelligent technologies. Consumer demand for natural products and increasingly extended and diverse supply chains required to feed the growing global population, mean that traditional packaging is becoming less capable of meeting the functional demands placed on it. To help ensure the commercial success of proposed smart packaging technologies a thorough understanding of consumers attitudes toward them is required. Understanding the cultural, social and cognitive factors that affect acceptance will help \u201cfine tune\u201d smart packaging development to best meet consumer preferences and needs and ensure that communication about the technologies effectively addresses consumer concerns and educates them on the benefits. This systematic review of 28 peer reviewed journal articles summarizes the current knowledge on consumer acceptance or rejection of active and intelligent packaging, and the behavioral forces behind those attitudes. Articles containing primary data and published in the English language over the last 10 years reporting consumer responses to active and/or intelligent packaging technologies in general or to more specific technologies that achieved the functional goals of active or intelligent packaging were obtained and analyzed for themes in the qualitative data analysis software NVivo. Themes were organized into groups as to whether they identified control variables, moderating variables, barriers or motivations to purchase and the benefits of the technology. To develop a conceptual framework for understanding consumer preferences for smart packaging, the identified themes were integrated with several consumer behavior models including the theory of planned behavior and an attitude model. Consumer perceptions of smart packaging is a poorly covered research area with most research being clustered in Europe and a smaller cluster in the Americas so there were significant opportunities to build on the body of knowledge.</p>",
